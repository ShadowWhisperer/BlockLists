This repository was made public in Feb of 2020.  All domains are from custom scripts and/or manual additions.  

```diff
- Notice
  Due to increasing scams, all generic remote support domains will be added to the Malware list.
```

## Usage Notes
- **Overlap**: Categories like *Ads* and *Tracking* may overlap.
- **Risk**: Blocking *Bloat*, *Free*, or *Marketing* may break stuff.
- **Typo**: Contains mostly dead domains. Avoid on low-end devices or when merging with your lists.
- **Wildcard Blocks**: Some domains may appear dead (e.g. `badsite.com`), but subdomains (e.g. `1.badsite.com`) may remain active.
- **Prefixes**: `www.`, `mobile.`, and `m.` are removed.

## Maintenance
- The repository is occasionally compressed to reduce size, removing logs, diffs, and previous commits.
- Dead or parked domains are periodically removed.

## Contributing
- Open an issue with category, domain, reason, and proof (if possible).
- I will not merge other lists
