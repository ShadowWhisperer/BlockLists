This repo was created: 2/14/2020.  https://api.github.com/repos/ShadowWhisperer/BlockLists  
The repo is compressed occasionally, to reduce the overall size. Logs, diff, etc. do not stay with the repo because of this.  
  
These lists are built using custom scripts, and manual additions. (All of my own)
<br />  
  
Some domains are used for both ads and tracking.  *Dating* may contain scam dating sites.  *Bloat*, *Free*, *Junk*, and *Marketing* will probably break stuff. *Typo* will have mostly dead domains. Not recommended to use on lower-end devices. If you're looking to merge my lists, I would advise you to skip *Typo*. You will get a lot of complaints of dead domains.  
<br />  

If you find sites that do not resolve an IP, it's probably a wildcard block. If _badsite.com_ is dead, _1.badsite.com_ is not. I remove dead/parked sites occasionally.  
<br />  

  
_www<span></span>._ _mobile._ _m._ prefixes are removed. They are added in the script below. This keeps the lists shorter.
